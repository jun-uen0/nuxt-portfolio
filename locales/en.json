      "description": "Nowadays, you can translate text files into any language. GCP, Bing Microsoft Translator, and so on. However, it costs a lot. You can use them freely until the limit. Although, someone figured out that you can use GCP translate for free. Google Apps Script has its original methods to use Google API, such as Maps API, YouTube API, and Translate API. They are all free. Each method has limitations. It would just stop. You don't need to register your credit card. In this project, you can create your own translate web API. See source code and try it."
